Hello, I am unable to setup a new banking account when logged in as Joey Berger. I can see the bank account of the LLC that I transferred a previous app to (Old EKG). However, for my upcoming app (Guitar Mult), I do not seem to have the option to add an account. Also, I do feel a little uncomfortable that I can see someone else's bank account. Any help would be appreciated. Joey
